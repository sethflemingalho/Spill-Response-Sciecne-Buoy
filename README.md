# Spill-Response-Science-Buoy
Iridium Environmental Monitoring Buoy

This buoy was desined with the purpose of monitoring environmental conditions around an oil spill. It has the ability to measure weather and surface/subsurface currents to aid in the safe recovery of environmental contaminants.

The buoy is equipped with a Teledyne Workhorse 300 ADCP, a Nortek Aquadopp, a Garmin GPS, a Campbell Scientific ClimaVue50, and an OpenMetBuoy wave logger. The Power bank is two LiFePO4 100AH 12V cold weather batteries. The buoy can recharge in the field using two 100W solar panels and a 440W wind turbine. All of the electronics are controlled using a Camplbell Scientific CR6 and the information is all transmitted through Iridium using a Rockblock+. The main hull is a Whaly 210 with a custom fabricated aluminum superstructure.
